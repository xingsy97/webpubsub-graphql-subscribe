# webpubsub-graphql-subscribe

## Introduction
[Microsoft Azure WebPub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-web-pubsub/overview) is a real-time messaging cloud service.
In GraphQL, `subscriptions` are long-lasting GraphQL read operations that can update their result whenever a particular server-side event occurs. And it is usually implemented with WebSocket protocol. 

Firstly, this package helps developers use Microsoft Azure WebPub service to avoid server-side maintenance of WebSocket connections between users clients and GraphQL server caused by `subscriptions` query from clients.

Secondly, this package provides a replacement for `PubSub` using Azure Web PubSub service. [PubSub](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/#the-pubsub-class) is an in-memory event-publishing system provided by [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/).

## How to deploy a demo 

1. Create a Microsoft Azure Web PubSub resource instance. Details are [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-web-pubsub/quickstart-serverless?tabs=javascript).

2. Use `ngrok` to expose our local endpoint to the public Internet

**Notice**: make sure the region of your Azure Web PubSub resource and the region of ngrok tunnel server are the same. For Example, if your Azure Web PubSub instance is located in Asia Pacific (ap) region , run your ngrok with parameter `--region=ap` as below. [Ngrok documents](https://ngrok.com/docs#global-locations) shows more location settings.
```
ngrok http --region=ap 8888 
```
Then you'll get a forwarding endpoint `http://{ngrok-id}.ngrok.io` like `http://1bff94a2f246.ap.ngrok.io`

3. Set `Event Handler` in Azure Web PubSub service. Go to **Azure portal** -> Find your Web PubSub resource -> **Settings**. Add two new hub settings as below. Replace the {ngrok-id} to yours. 

| Hub Name: graphql_main                         |                    |                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| URL Template                                   | User Event Pattern | System Events                  |
| http://{ngrok-id}.ngrok.io/wps-services/main   | *                  | connect,connected,disconnected |


| Hub Name: graphql_pubsub                       |                    |                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| URL Template                                   | User Event Pattern | System Events                  |
| http://{ngrok-id}.ngrok.io/wps-services/pubsub | *                  | connect,connected,disconnected |

4. Clone this repository and install required package
```git
git clone https://github.com/xingsy97/webpubsub-graphql-subscribe
cd webpubsub-graphql-subscribe
npm install
```

5. Rename file `example-settings.js` to `settings.js`. Then replace its `<web-pubsub-connection-string>` with your own Azure Web PubSub connection string.

6. Run the demo
```bash
npm run demo
```

7. Open your web browser like Google Chrome, visit `http://localhost:4000`.
Copy the following GraphQL query to the left panel.
```gql
subscription sampleSubscription {
  numberIncremented
}
```
Then click the play button and watch the right pannel.

## Implementations
- class `WpsWebSocketServer`
  - Original GraphQL subscriptions implementation starts up a WebSocket server which listens to clients and maintains WebSocket connections in server-side. 
  - This class replaces original `WebSocket.Server` and communicate between the server and WebPub service using HTTP protocol.
  - And clients use WebSocket communicates with WebPub service rather than directly communicate with our server by WebSocket.

- class `WpsPubSub`
  - It implements the `PubSubEngine` Interface from the `graphql-subscriptions` package using Azure Web PubSub service.
  - It replaces the original in-memory event system `PubSub` and allows you to connect your subscriptions manager to an Azure Web PubSub service to support multiple subscription manager instances.

## How to Integrate this package into an existing Apollo server 
- `./src/tests/test.ts` is modified from an [example](https://github.com/apollographql/docs-examples/blob/7105d77acfc67d6cb4097cc27a7956051ec0c1b5/server-subscriptions-as3/index.js) provided by Apollo GraphQL. 
- `test.ts` shows how to integrate `WpsWebSocketServer` and `WpsPubSub` into an existing Apollo server. Refer to its code and comments for details.
